Introduction
============

This is my best effort to document the Nintendo Switch, from an emulation standpoint. I'm writing this in parallel with [UmbraNX](https://github.com/daeken/SharpRetro/tree/main/UmbraCore), so I'll be covering things scattershot as I understand and implement them.

Some sections are being written or scaffolded using LLMs; these are explicitly noted. ***DO NOT*** trust anything noted as AI-generated; if it's been verified and edited properly (read: rewritten) by a human, it won't have the note anymore.
